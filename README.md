# Roman Numerals Generator 
----------
The problem

In whatever language you prefer, write a class that implements the following interface (example given in Java):

public interface RomanNumeralGenerator {
    public String generate(int number);
}

For example, see the following sample inputs and outputs:

1 = “I”
5 = “V”
10 = “X”
20 = “XX”
3999 = “MMMCMXCIX”

Caveat: Only support numbers between 1 and 3999

For an in-depth description of Roman Numerals, see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_numerals
